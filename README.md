The details of the goals are below. This was a very difficult assignment for me. I had to break down my understanding of 
javascript and reorganize it. I developed a love for console logging to see where my code is heading. I reached out to TAs, instructors in office hours, and many other students in an effort to find my way here. I spent 10 hours today studying to figure this out. What I've provided is a code that will accept user's input password criteria. It works if only some of the criteria is entered. It works if no criteria is entered, prompting the user to try again, and it works in denying usage of a number of characters not allowed. The code loops so that if the user fails to correctly input choices, it will run again. The code takes randomized characters from arrays and builds a password with them. Once the randomized password is created, the code prints that on the user's viewport. Although difficult, I had fun with this project, and enjoyed the mental breakthroughs of clarity that came along with it. Be sure to go through the viewport and click cancel on all the confirmations, thats my favorite.





# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
